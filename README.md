This a collection of data analysis and visualization routines I wrote as part of my summer work at Caltech. I numerically studied the statistical properties of a recently discovered hydrodynamical instability that arises in coupled systems of astrophysical gas and dust.

This work was done within the Theoretical Astrophysics Department under the mentorship of Prof. Philip Hopkins and Dr. Jonathan Squire.
